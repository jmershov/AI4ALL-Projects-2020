# AI4ALL Projects 2020
<br>

This repository consists of the main project that I made during the Columbia AI4All Summer Program in 2020. I collaborated with three other students. The main project was to create an AI to give song recommendations, aiming to suggest music of the same caliber while also helping underrepresented artists. We polled the other students and faculty from the program and slightly modified the code according to those results. 

For this project, we used the [Spotify Tracks Database](https://www.kaggle.com/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db) by Zaheen Hamidani, a database containing about 232k songs, artist name, popularity, and a variety of other statistics about the songs that were useful in determining how similar two songs are. 

This repository has our presentation in it as well, and that has more information on what we were aiming to achieve.
